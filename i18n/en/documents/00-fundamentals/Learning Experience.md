The texts that impressed me the most

Huangdi Yinfu Jing: Sever the benefit from one source, and use the master ten times. Three repetitions day and night, and use the master ten thousand times.

Douyin says: People are driven by profit; great profit leads to great deeds, small profit to small deeds, and no profit to no deeds.
